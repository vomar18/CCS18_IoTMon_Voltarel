# CCS18_IoTMon_Voltarel
implementation of the paper "On the Safety of IoT Device Physical Interaction Control" by Wenbo Ding and Hongxin Hu.

The project is subdivided into 3 major components:
1. Application Analysis
    1. Intra-app analysis:
        - table 2: trigger-actions
    3. Physical channel identification.
        - table 1: physical channels identification
        - table 3:physical channels and associated capabilities
2. Interaction Chain Discovery
3. Risk Analysis & Mitigation
    1. channel tuple frequency analysis
    2. channel value assignment
    3. vector value assignment
    4. similarity calculation
